#### [Demo on youtube (with Transcript in the description) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUhjkleqBeM)

- ### Instruction manual:
  - `Encrypt`:
    + Press `E` then enter a key, press enter and start typing the text to encrypt.
    + Text has to be ALL UPPERCASE.
  - `Decrypt`:
    + Press `D` then enter a key, press enter and start typing the text to decrypt.
    + Text can be uppercase or lowercase.
  - `Start processing`:
    + Embed `@` to the end of your text so that the program can start text processing.
  - ***Notes***:
    + You will find the processed (i.e. encrypted / decrypted) text in `output.txt` file
      + In case of running from tasm, you will find it in "..\GUI Turbo Assembler\BIN" folder.
      + In case of running the executable with DOSBox, you will find it in the same directory as the executable. 
    + You can enter numbers, new lines, or even special characters (except for `@` as I am using it as a start sign). this will not break my code. :D
